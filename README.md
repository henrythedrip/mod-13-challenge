## Description

Understanding the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites is crucial for developers looking to build robust and scalable selling platforms online. Here, we are practicing to build the backend of an e-commerce website. We are taking a working Express.js API and configuring it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This README will also contain a walk through video that will show the functionality of the backend ecommerce database. 

## Installation

First, users must install NPM through the command-line interface. This can be done with the command `npm install` Once installed, they must use the command `npm run start` to start. This is able to be accomplished with one command thanks to the presence of a package.json file that contains the packages we need to install. They must also use Insomnia to view the backend working. 

## Usage

Here is a video walk through guide of the program and how it works:
